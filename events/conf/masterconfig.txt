# the safest way to make changes is to copy this file, run the config checker on

# dates can be expressed in a lot of different formats. to be safe, use something

# tabs/extra spaces/extra newlines are all ok.

# when naming test config files, try to stay away from goofy characters that
# appear in URLs like quotes, pluses, equals, ampersands, and spaces.
